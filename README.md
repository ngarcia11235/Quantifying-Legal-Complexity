# Quantifying-Legal-Complexity
 The purpose of this project is to generate quantitative data about the complexity of law contained in a database of justian's digest (digest.db)
 
 to produce results you can run generate_dictionary.py using digest.db as an input and then run graphs_and_tables.py with the output which will create a more readable dataset.
